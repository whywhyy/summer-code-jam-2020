                    The year is 1995. The release of consumer-friendly browsers like Mosaic and Netscape are quickly making the internet a household name throughout the world.
                    Venture capital firms are tossing money at any upstart tech company with a ".com" in their name. IPOs are being valuated in the hundreds of millions of dollars
                    despite never turning a profit or releasing a successful product. The information age has dawned upon the new millenia and there is profit to be made... or is
                    there?

                    <br />
                    Between approximately 1995 and 2000 the NASDAQ rose nearly 400% only to come crashing back down by 78% in 2002 -- a period that has come to be known as the
                    "Dotcom Bubble". Prior to the bursting of the bubble, many quit their jobs to try their hand at the new gold rush of day trading. Some made fortunes from
                    employee stock options or day-trading, but far many more squandered their wealth on bad bets.

                    In Sparrow Capital you will try your hand at playing the market right at the start of the bubble to see if you have what it would have taken to make it big.
                    You will start with a small initial bank and, over the course of the 7 year period, buy &amp; sell the shares of over 150 companies to build your portfolio. Will
                    you pick the winners that make your millions? Will you sell right at the top of the market before it's all gone before your eyes? Or will the burst of the
                    bubble have you wishing that Y2K was as bad as they said it was going to be?
