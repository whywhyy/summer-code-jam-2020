Having said that...i know for sure that i'm a gay white\\nMale living in sf for the past 26 years and self-employed in a\\nProfession that i really enjoy. Being creative and getting paid for\\nIt is pretty cool. I like where i live and usually love the people\\nThat surround me, sometimes not, you know we all have our moods. I\\nAlso know that i'd like to meet a decent, honest, caring and\\nPassionate guy that i can count on to ride with me through this\\nCrazy world. Generally speaking though, you'll probably find me to\\nBe a very easy going, fun guy with a lot of interests, very honest,\\nA lot of passion and a really good heart and soul. I'm a pretty\\nPlayful guy, i like men who can be boyish in that way, knowing when\\nTo be serious and when to let loose and have fun being a kid. I\\nTend to be attracted to guys who are more on the active side in and\\nOut of the sack, guys who are comfortable hiking, biking, being in\\nThe ocean, basically moving your body, not interested in couch\\nDwellers. In addition, emotionally available guys are where it's at\\nFor me. If you can communicate with me, that's a big plus, we're\\nHalf way there. I'm not into drama, save it for the stage. Like\\nEveryone, i have my faults and i'll be the first to admit\\nIt...perfection is completely overrated. I'm authentic and real and\\nUnderstanding, but i do have a very low tolerance for people who\\nAren't. Physically, emotionally and spiritually, i take care of\\nMyself and invest time and energy into those parts of myself and\\nI'm drawn to people who do the same. I like to be active, but not\\nScheduled out, i need my down time. I enjoy being outdoors and\\nBeing social but also like to hang out alone at home or just take a\\nWalk on the beach by myself to recharge. I get a lot of comfort and\\nPleasure from the ocean. When i surf, i find it so amazing to be in\\nThe water, surrounded by sea life and viewing the coast from out\\nThere. Riding a wave is an incredible feeling, being powered by\\nNature and feeling so in sync with life, so much a part of nature.\\nThat's my deeper side talking.\\nMost of my friends have been with me for years, some as long as\\nGrade school. I'm really loyal that way. It's very comforting to\\nHave a long history with people, helps to ground me.\\nMy family is really cool and wants to see me with a nice guy that\\nThey can embarrass me in front of. Isn't that what families are\\nFor, to remind us of where we came from and how far we've\\nEvolved...hopefully. My mom is really great, she's 83 and is so\\nActive, doing yoga and aerobics, taking trips, drinking boxed wine\\nWith friends, volunteering, keeping the family together and\\nDrinking more boxed wine with friends. We're big fans of each\\nOther. I have a large extended family, aunts, uncles, cousins and\\nWe get together usually once a year at thanksgiving. They always\\nGet excited when i bring a new guy around. You know the gay\\nRelative with a new boyfriend is a novelty in most families. I\\nThink it makes them feel hip and cool and that works for me.\\nOn the serious side, i'm hiv- if that matters to you one way or the\\nOther.\\nWell enough about me. I hope i've given you some insight into who i\\nAm and the type of man i'm looking to meet; besides, i'm tired of\\nWriting about myself. So if you're interested let me know, give me\\nA wink or whatever the hell it is they do on this site to\\nCommunicate an interest.\\nHope you find what you're looking for. We all deserve that don't\\nWe?",

I would love to spend more time traveling to exciting places, enjoying\\nLive music and\\nUnusual shows (i once got to experience willy wonka in\\nSmell-o-vision -- more like this, please!), and discovering the\\nHidden secrets of the bay.\\n\\nI'm looking for people who will revel in life -- who can find the\\nHumor in everyday\\nSituations, who appreciate the first signs of the changing of the\\nSeasons, who love to concoct crazy schemes, and occasionally even\\nSee them through.

I hail from the embarrassing state\\nOf arizona. (if you don't know what i mean, this article will catch\\nYou up:\\nHttp://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/24/total-eclipse/.)\\nArizona lays claim to some wonderful people and phenomenal sunsets\\n... But i knew, even as a child, that it was not the state for\\nMe.\\n\\nFifteen years after my prescient declaration, i drove my car\\nFourteen hours west, with a friend driving my belongings in a\\nU-haul truck behind me. As we crossed the bay bridge*, i cried,\\nReflecting on how long i'd wished to live here, and hardly\\nBelieving that my residency launch date had arrived. I have been in\\nLove with this city every day of the thirteen years since.\\n\\n*the golden gate bridge would have made this story far more\\nRomantic.\\n\\nBetween the article i cited and my san francisco love story, you\\nKnow my politics. I am fixed on that side, and i sit at the edge\\nFarthest from the aisle. If i ever land on a particular spiritual\\nPath, i'll let you know; i am more inquisitive and open-minded on\\nThat one.\\n\\nThe overused term \\\"intellectually curious\\\" describes me. I am also\\nEmotional, and my sensitivity extends to others in the form of\\nCompassion. If you know astrology, i am an aquarius with a scorpio\\nMoon and libra rising. On myers-briggs, i'm an enfj. Facebook says\\nThe downton abbey character i personify is lady sybil.\\n\\nI love dancing, running, and singing along to my ipod. If you need\\nAn aggressive sweeper on your soccer team, look no further: i\\nHaven't kicked a ball in years, but when i played in an indoor\\nSoccer league with several european men, the other side almost\\nNever got past me. I'm not that great at strategy or aim, but i was\\nThe last defensive line on a goalie-free court, and i couldn't\\nStand letting the team down. So i rarely did.\\n\\nI seek a partner who is funny, kind, smart, and good to the core -\\nA trait that overlaps with kind, but speaks more to character,\\nWhich is important to me. As a partner, i am loyal, honest,\\nTrusting, and independent. I love talking for hours, and i am\\nHighly social. I also need a fair amount of alone time, and i know\\nHow to ask for it. I am affectionate, funny, and thoughtful. I like\\nMen who are, too.",

I was walking up the hill\\nTo alamo sq park from my new apartment. It's this beautiful park at\\nThe very top of a hill, surrounded by beautiful victorians, with a\\nView of much of the city. Big, windswept cypress trees grow there, and there's a shoe\\nGarden and a place for dogs to play. There was this moment, at\\nAlmost 6pm, when the sun was just thinking about setting for the\\nEvening, and the fog was meandering in over the sunset, and a\\nMission bell was ringing in the distance, where the wind caught my\\nHair and i felt like i was exactly where i should be, in that\\nMoment. That i finally understood san francisco and what it has to\\nOffer me.\\n\\nI am a sophisticated, playful, intuitive woman who knows what she\\nWants, and isn't afraid to ask for it.

I think it's because i have a\\nFriendly face and an open energy. I like it because i get to hear\\nStories and collect them for future use. I love weird people,\\nCharacters, tricksters and fools. I see coyote everywhere and he\\nReminds me to laugh at myself above all else.\\n\\nDisclaimer 1: i don't usually respond to chat messages because a\\nFew idiots have ruined it for the rest of you by being nasty. I'd\\nLike to at least have one or two email conversations first before\\nChatting, but i'd be happy to chat after that.\\n\\nDisclaimer 2: i'm a little weird around the edges. I'm kind of an\\nUrban witch, i have a cauldron and an altar, i sometimes howl at\\nThe moon, but i'm also super modern and practical. I like computers\\nAnd high heels and hiking and meteor showers. I like shoe polish\\nAnd i also like mud and i like my men that way too.\\n\\nDisclaimer 3: i'm kind of an old soul who has learned how live in\\nThe now and be more childlike. I'm super playful, but i've got some\\nDeep, dark depths where i hide a lot of wisdom. I'm looking for\\nSomeone who is evolved in those ways too, i don't want to teach\\nAnyone.

Yeah!\\n-----\\n\\nPart human, part kale, and part well-kerned font. - that's from the\\nDays when it was mandatory and i still like it.\\n\\nWhile 'working on myself' is a serious part of my life, my nature\\nTends toward being goofy, silly, funny, with a side of sexy, and a\\nSharper-than-the edge of a recently opened tin can- wit. Wit is\\nGreat but what tickles my fancy more than sharp wit is great\\nAdventure. Adventures, especially of the spontaneous and surprising\\nVariety, are incredibly satisfying. They are especially so if\\nInvolving a road trip, hot springs, hiking, treasure hunting for\\nThe little jewels of nature, and if i'm in a relationship then it\\nWould definitely include highly sensational make-outs, sex, a bit\\nOf kink, cuddling, etc. Yup, i am a woman who enjoys sex!\\n\\nSo, i'm originally from the 'burbs of philly and made it out to sf\\nIn july, 2003. I was going to stay \\\"just for a year\\\". Now it is 8+\\nYears later and i'm still here! i've lived all over sf and am\\nCurrently in soma, living in a beautiful, engaging, and intense\\nCommunity of 50 friends who are more like family. It's never a dull\\nMoment, that's for sure.\\n\\nAs for passions i love doing my healing work for others including\\nChinese medicine and life coaching. My work did include massage but\\nI hurt my shoulder so kneading people is on hiatus until further\\nNotice. Hehe, kneading people. See- silly goofy corny, right before\\nYour eyes!\\n\\nIn what feels like a former life i was a graphic designer. While i\\nStill get off on a well-balanced font, or the brilliant color and\\nComposition of a well designed poster i have left designing as a\\nCareer path. The pressure of deadlines, 8+ hrs / day at a computer,\\nAnd not feeling like i was making a significant contribution to the\\nWorld led me to the healing arts / sciences. So, here i am - driven\\nBy my purpose and happier than i've ever been. :-)",
