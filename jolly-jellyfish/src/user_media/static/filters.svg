<!--
    CSS Image filters for themes.

    Columns in the colour matrices represent input bands (R, G, B, A, 1),
    and rows represent output output bands (R, G, B, A).
    Consider the following row in a matrix:
        l m n o p
    If this were the first row, the value red band in the output colour would
    be determined by the following formula:
        rl + mg + nb + oa + 255p
    Where r, g, b and a were the input values for red, green, blue and yellow.
    This process is applied to every band in every pixel to produce the output
    image.
