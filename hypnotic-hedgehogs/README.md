# **Hypnotic Hedgehogs** present... *A Brief History of the Internet*

## Time sure flies...

...and the 90's internet is now 30 years old — which means many current internauts didn't experience the glory of the dial-up age! 

Our project aims to mimic the early Internet experience, where some old friends help navigating the uncharted territory of nineties nostalgia. 

#### Available features:

- establish a connection to the World Wide Web! 🌏
- enjoy our implementation of 90's era Youtube, Twitter, and Google — and also Bob's greatest 90's blog! 🖥️
- and all this with precious help from Clippy and Merlin! 📎

#### Required utilities:
Our project is containerised with Docker -- thus the user must have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed in the environment.

#### Running the application:
1. Navigate to the ```hypnotic-hedgehogs``` directory.
2. Run the ```docker-compose up -d``` command in your terminal.

The project should be accessible through your browser, at ```localhost:8000``` (where ```localhost``` is usually ```127.0.0.1:8000```).
