# TimeScape

> _Wish we could turn back time... to the good old days_  
> ~ TwentyOnePilots

The sound of a box monitor turning on... The feeling of electrons running into your hands from the display glass... The smell of ozone... Brought back a few memories, didn't I?
Well, nostalgia is a nice feeling, and I'm here to deal you more of it. Hop on the nostalgia train called: **TimeScape**! You'll be able to drag your way through history in a show of the evolution of search engines over time.

## Setup


1. Make sure you have Docker installed.
2. Add `tokens.js` to `/timescape` (for Pydis admins: you'll find it with f1re)
3. Run ```docker-compose up --build --detach```
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
5. That's it!

Whenever you're done, use `docker-compose stop`.
