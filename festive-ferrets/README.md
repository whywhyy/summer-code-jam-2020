Have you ever wondered what it was like to be one of the first web-developers ever?
When you could count all competitors in your field on one hand?
What would you have created in this situation?
A buggy message board and an unfinished game of tictactoe? **Exactly**!

Visit the live version of our site [here](http://code-jam-2020.jannisk.de/).

## Motivation

This project was created for the [Python Discord Summer Code Jam 2020](https://pythondiscord.com/pages/code-jams/code-jam-7/) in August 2020.
The goal was to develop a Django-based web application with the theme "Early Internet".
You can find the main repository of the code jam [here](https://github.com/python-discord/summer-code-jam-2020).

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jannisko/summer-code-jam-2020.git
cd summer-code-jam-2020/festive-ferrets/
```

### Backend

The backend for this project was written in Python 3.8, using Django 3 as a framework.

First install all necessary Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

By default the Django will use the config file ```backend/dev.env```.
You can change some of the behavior there.

Run all tests:
```bash
python backend/manage.py migrate
python backend/manage.py test
```

Then run the development server on port 80 using:
```bash
python backend/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:80
```


### Frontend

The frontend was created using node.js 14 and Angular.

First install the the dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend/code-jam
npm install
```

Then start the development server on port 4200 using:
```bash
npm start
```

## Deployment

To deploy using Docker first rename ```db.env.example``` to ```db.env.prod``` and ```django.env.example``` to ```django.env.prod```.
You should also change these files to suit your needs.

To then start all services type:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
